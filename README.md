# Braccio Proof Of Concept
A proof of concept for a robotic arm controller. Written in Python and C++.

The main motivation behind this project is an issue I have with my robot arm.
Since it uses Arduino, I cannot control the arm in real-time.
I must upload a C++ script to the controller *then* run it.
This is really annoying and I think it would be much easier if I could control the robot arm in real time.
